# Soundwave

Soundwave is a simple static file generator. Its primary use is for building static web sites, and in that sense it's similar to Tom Preston-Werner's Jekyll. But Soundwave can also bootstrap web application projects, or basically do anything that involves processing data or copying a directory structure lots and lots of times.
