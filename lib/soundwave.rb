# **Soundwave** is a tool for generating static web pages with structured data,
# with [Mustache][mo] or [Tilt][tilt] templates, and data files formatted as 
# YAML or JSON. I use it to rapidly prototype blog themes, and other kinds of
# highly structured websites.
#
# Information on installing and using Soundwave can be found in the README.
#
# Before I forget: Soundwave is &copy;2012â€” [David Demaree](http://demaree.me),
# released as open source software under the MIT license.
#
#### Prerequisites

# [Hike](http://github.com/sstephenson/hike) is used to set up and query load paths.
# We'll be using it to find partials, data files, and (in `Soundwave::Server`) templates.
require 'hike'

# [MultiJson](http://github.com/intridea/multi_json) is a universal Ruby wrapper around
# several popular JSON parsing and decoding libraries.
require 'multi_json'

# Next, load in some bits of Soundwave stored in other files:
require 'soundwave/page'


#### Public Interface

module Soundwave
  VERSION = '0.4.0'

  # Most major stuff in Soundwave revolves around the `Site` class. Sites are
  # collections of templates and other files stored in a directory in the filesystem.

  class Site

    attr_accessor :source, :data_dir

    # `Soundwave::Site.new` takes an optional `source` path, defaults to the current directory.
    def initialize(source="./")
      @source = Pathname(source).expand_path
      # `data_dir` defaults to the `_data` directory under `source`.
      @data_dir = source.join("_data")
    end

    # The aptly named `generate` takes a `destination` path for the generated web pages.
    def generate(destination)
      destination = Pathname(destination).expand_path
      # First, we find all of the renderable files in the project and iterate over that list.
      #
      # Next, we create a [Page](./soundwave/page.html) object for each file and write it to
      # the destination path.
      find_paths.each do |path|
        page = Page.new(self, path)
        page.write(destination.join(page.output_path))
      end
    end

    # `find_paths` returns a filtered list of all the pages/assets in the site.
    def find_paths(dir="")
      base = File.join(@source, dir)
      entries = Dir.chdir(base) { filter_entries(Dir["*"]) }
      paths = []

      entries.each do |entry|
        absolute_path = File.join(base, entry)
        relative_path = File.join(dir, entry)

        if File.directory?(absolute_path)
          paths.concat find_paths(relative_path)
        else
          paths << absolute_path
        end
      end
      paths
    end

    # `filter_entries` is a utility method for filtering out files/directories that should not be published:
    # 
    # * Files starting with _ or #
    # * Swap files ending in a tilde (~)
    # * Symbolic links
    def filter_entries(entries)
      entries = entries.reject do |e|
        unless ['.htaccess'].include?(e)
          ['_', '#'].include?(e[0..0]) ||
          e[-1..-1] == '~' ||
          File.symlink?(e)
        end
      end
    end

    def data_trail
